## Course Objectives
This course surveys the iconographic and literary evidence for the construction of gender and sexuality in ancient Greece and Rome. The definitions of such concepts as love, masculinity, femininity, homoeroticism, courtship, and marriage, among others, have displayed both remarkable continuity in some aspects but also radical change in others from the ancient Greeks and Romans to modern times. This course aims to establish a baseline for ancient conceptions of gender and sexuality and invites students to compare and contrast these notions with those of contemporaneous societies and of the modern day.
