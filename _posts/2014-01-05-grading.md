## Grading Contract

Grading and assessments in this course will be unorthodox. We will be following a form of *specification grading*, in which all assignments and assessments are graded on a **satisfactory** or **unsatisfactory** basis. Each assignment and assessment will have an explicit set of guidelines and criteria for what will be considered “satisfactory.” Your semester grade, then, will be based on the number and type of satisfactory assignments and assessments completed. In other words, *you* will be in control of your semester grade — *you* decide the grade that you want and commit as much time or energy towards that grade as you desire.
